# Generative-model-GAN-VAE-using-pytorch

implement **GANs** and **VAE** using **pytorch**

GANs include **DCGAN LSGAN WGAN WGAN-GP**
VAE is from the paper **Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes**

in my code, i use MNIST to test the network, but its very easy to switch dataset of you own

here is result when i training DCGAN at 36 epoch
